# Tiny Calculator in Assembly (MASM)

## Description
This is a simple command-line calculator built using **MASM Assembly**. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as:
- Addition (`a` or `A`)
- Subtraction (`s` or `S`)
- Multiplication (`m` or `M`)
- Division (`d` or `D`)
- Modulo (`%`)
- Memory Recall (`R` or `r`)
- Variable Assignment (`=`)

It accepts user input, performs calculations, and displays a final report summarizing the operations performed.

## Features
- Stores user calculations in memory for recall.
- Supports variable assignment for single-letter variables (`A-Z`).
- Handles division-by-zero errors.
- Provides a detailed summary of total operations performed.

## Technologies Used
- **MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)**
- **Irvine32 Library** for input/output handling.

## Installation & Running the Program
1. Install **MASM** and the **Irvine32 library**.
